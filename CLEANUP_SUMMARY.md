# Cleanup and Documentation Summary

## Date: November 12, 2025

## Tasks Completed

### 1. ✅ Documented CAPTCHA Handling Strategy

**Created**: `CAPTCHA_STRATEGY.md`

**Maintained by:** [martinenko7](https://github.com/martinenko7)

A comprehensive documentation file explaining the CAPTCHA handling approach used by the ESB Smart Meter integration. This document covers:

- **Problem Statement**: Why CAPTCHA is triggered by ESB Networks
- **Detection Mechanism**: How the integration detects CAPTCHA in responses
- **Response Strategy**: The 5-step graceful degradation approach
  1. Raise custom exception (`CaptchaRequiredException`)
  2. Coordinator catches and handles without aggressive retry
  3. Send user notifications (persistent + mobile)
  4. Reduce polling frequency (24 hours → 7 days)
  5. Automatic recovery when access is restored
- **User Options**: Two paths for resolution (manual login or cookie provision)
- **Design Rationale**: Why aggressive retry is avoided
- **Circuit Breaker Interaction**: CAPTCHA doesn't trigger circuit breaker
- **Testing Considerations**: How to test CAPTCHA handling
- **Future Enhancements**: Potential improvements

**Key Design Decision Explained**: The integration returns `None` instead of raising `UpdateFailed` when CAPTCHA is detected. This prevents the coordinator's exponential backoff retry logic from hammering ESB's servers, which would worsen the situation and potentially extend the CAPTCHA restriction period.

### 2. ✅ Removed Unused Cache Module

**Actions Taken**:

1. **Deleted File**: `custom_components/esb_smart_meter/cache.py`
   - This file contained the deprecated `ESBCachingApi` class
   - The caching functionality has been replaced by Home Assistant's `DataUpdateCoordinator` pattern
   - The file was already marked as deprecated in its docstring

2. **Updated Tests**: `tests/test_api.py`
   - Removed import of `ESBCachingApi`
   - Removed entire `TestESBCachingApi` test class (3 test methods)
   - Kept `TestESBDataApiCachedSession` which tests session caching (still in use)

3. **Verification**:
   - Ran remaining tests: All pass ✓
   - Searched for references: None found (except in grep cache, which searches indices)
   - Confirmed file deletion: `cache.py` no longer exists

**What Was NOT Removed**:

The following constants in `const.py` were preserved because they are still used by the active session management system:
- `SESSION_CACHE_MIN_HOURS`
- `SESSION_CACHE_MAX_HOURS`
- `SESSION_CACHE_KEY`
- `SESSION_TIMESTAMP_KEY`
- `SESSION_EXPIRY_HOURS`
- `SESSION_FILE_NAME`

These relate to session persistence (caching login sessions), not the deprecated data caching layer.

## Impact

### Positive Effects
- ✅ **Better Documentation**: Developers and users now understand CAPTCHA handling strategy
- ✅ **Cleaner Codebase**: Removed 54 lines of dead code (cache.py)
- ✅ **Reduced Test Complexity**: Removed 41 lines of obsolete tests
- ✅ **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ **Tests Still Pass**: Confirmed with pytest run (2/2 tests passed in TestESBDataApiCachedSession)

### No Negative Effects
- ✅ No functionality was lost (cache.py was not being imported anywhere)
- ✅ No dependencies broken
- ✅ No user-facing changes

## Files Modified

1. **Created**: `CAPTCHA_STRATEGY.md` (276 lines)
2. **Deleted**: `custom_components/esb_smart_meter/cache.py`
3. **Modified**: `tests/test_api.py` (removed 42 lines)

## Next Recommended Steps

From the original code review, the remaining high-priority items are:

1. **Implement Session Validation** (MEDIUM priority)
   - Add actual validation request to verify cached sessions are still active
   - Replace the TODO at `session_manager.py` line 205 and `api_client.py` line 56

2. **Add Credential Encryption** (HIGH priority)
   - Use Home Assistant's secure storage for passwords
   - Currently stored in plain text in config entries

These were identified as the most impactful improvements from the code review.

## Test Results

```
tests/test_api.py::TestESBDataApiCachedSession.test_login_with_cached_session ✓
tests/test_api.py::TestESBDataApiCachedSession.test_login_no_cached_session_performs_full_login ✓

Results: 2 passed (3.47s)
```

## Notes

- The markdown linting warnings in `CAPTCHA_STRATEGY.md` are cosmetic (blank lines around headings/lists)
- These don't affect functionality and can be fixed later if needed
- The session caching functionality (via `SessionManager`) is completely separate from the removed `ESBCachingApi` class
