## Current Situation

ESB Networks has implemented reCAPTCHA protection on their login system to prevent automated access. The integration currently:

- ✅ Detects reCAPTCHA presence (`g-recaptcha-response`, `captcha.html`)
- ✅ Provides clear error messages to users
- ✅ Implements 24-hour backoff after detection
- ❌ Cannot bypass or solve reCAPTCHA automatically

**Detection Logic (api_client.py:200-221):**
```python
if (
    "g-recaptcha-response" in content
    or "captcha.html" in content
    or 'error_requiredFieldMissing":"Please confirm you are not a robot' in content
):
    raise ValueError(
        "ESB Networks requires CAPTCHA verification. "
        "Automated login is currently not possible."
    )
```

## Legal & Ethical Considerations

### Terms of Service (ToS)

**reCAPTCHA Terms (Google):**
> You may not [...] use any automated means to access, use or scrape the CAPTCHA Service, or attempt to circumvent the CAPTCHA Service or any security features.

**ESB Networks Likely Position:**
- ESB implemented CAPTCHA specifically to prevent automation
- Circumventing CAPTCHA likely violates their acceptable use policy
- Could potentially lead to account suspension

### Ethical Considerations

#### ❌ **Against Automation:**
- **Playwright-reCAPTCHA**: Directly circumvents intended security
- **CapSolver/2Captcha**: Explicitly violates ToS
- **ML Models**: Same as above, plus technically challenging

#### ⚠️ **Gray Area:**
- **Browser Extensions**: User-initiated but still automated
- **Session Reuse**: Extends valid sessions (probably acceptable)

#### ✅ **Ethical:**
- **User-Assisted Flow**: User solves CAPTCHA themselves
- Respects ESB's security measures
- No ToS violations
- No third-party privacy concerns

### Legal Risks

| Solution | Legal Risk | Account Ban Risk | Enforcement Likelihood |
|----------|-----------|------------------|----------------------|
| Playwright-reCAPTCHA | Medium | Medium-High | Medium |
| CapSolver/2Captcha | High | High | High |
| Browser Extensions | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| ML Models | High | High | High |
| Session Reuse | Low | Low | Low |
| User-Assisted | None | None | None |

**Note:** While unlikely to result in legal action, account suspension is a real risk. Users losing access to their energy data is a significant concern.

2. Send persistent Home Assistant notification with:
   - Clear explanation
   - Deep link to ESB login page
   - Instructions to copy session cookie
3. Provide config flow UI for cookie input
4. Resume integration with provided session

**User Experience:**
```
Notification Title: "ESB Smart Meter - Manual Login Required"
Message: "ESB Networks requires CAPTCHA verification. 
         Please visit https://myaccount.esbnetworks.ie 
         and log in manually. Then provide your session 
         cookie in the integration settings."

- If ESB explicitly permits automation
- If ESB implements OAuth or similar user-friendly auth

---

### 🤔 **Conditional Option: CapSolver API as Opt-In**

**If you must provide automated CAPTCHA solving:**

**Implementation:**
1. Make it **opt-in** via configuration
2. Require explicit user acknowledgment of risks:
   - ToS violation
   - Account ban risk  
   - Privacy implications
3. Document all risks clearly in README
4. Use only as fallback after user-assisted flow

**Configuration:**
```yaml
esb_smart_meter:
  captcha_solving:
    enabled: false  # Disabled by default
    method: "manual"  # Options: manual, capsolver
    capsolver_api_key: !secret capsolver_key  # Only if method=capsolver
    accept_risks: false  # Must be explicitly set to true
```

**Benefits:**
- Gives advanced users the option
- Default behavior remains ethical
- Clear risk disclosure

**Risks:**
- May encourage ToS violations
